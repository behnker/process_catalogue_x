# Business Model Integration Guide
## Linking Processes to Value Creation

---

## Executive Summary

The **Business Model Integration** extends the Operating Model Framework by connecting every process to **how value is created and captured**. This creates a direct line of sight from **operational execution â†’ business model â†’ financial performance**.

### What's New

| Component | Purpose | Key Question |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **Business Model Mapping** | Links processes to BM components | Which markets, clients, categories does this process serve? |
| **Business Model Reference** | Complete taxonomy of BM components | What are our categories, clients, markets, partners? |
| **Value Chain Visibility** | Shows contribution to revenue/cost | How does this process create value or consume resources? |

---

## Why Business Model Mapping Matters

### The Missing Link

Most process catalogues answer **"what we do"** and **"how we do it"**, but fail to answer **"why it matters to the business"**.

**Business Model Mapping solves this by showing:**

âœ… Which processes generate revenue vs. enable revenue  
âœ… Which markets/clients depend on specific processes  
âœ… Which categories drive process complexity  
âœ… Which functions own which value streams  
âœ… How costs are allocated across the operating model

## Process-to-Business-Model Examples

### Example 1: Brief (L2-10)

**Process:** Client requirements capture

**Business Model Linkage:**
- **Trading Markets:** UK, Benelux, Australia (all markets use this process)
- **Clients:** Bunnings, Selco, Maxeda (all clients trigger briefs)
- **Sourcing Markets:** China, Vietnam (brief defines where to source)
- **Categories:** Technical, Showroom, Seasonal, Home (applies to all categories)
- **Partners:** N/A (internal process, no external partners needed)
- **Suppliers:** N/A (not yet engaged at brief stage)
- **Channel:** Agent (we act as intermediary)
- **Revenue Line:** Agency margin (quality briefs â†’ better quotes â†’ higher conversion â†’ revenue)
- **Cost Line:** Account team time (salaries for account managers/executives)
- **Function:** Sourcing Merchandising
- **Value Proposition:** Requirements capture â†’ Ensures Surity sources what client actually needs
- **Customer Segment:** DIY retailers (primary beneficiary)
- **BM Notes:** "Starts sourcing cycle - poor brief quality cascades to all downstream processes"

**Insight:** This process is a **revenue enabler**. While it doesn't directly generate margin, it determines the **quality of the entire sourcing cycle**. Investing in better brief processes â†’ better product-market fit â†’ higher client satisfaction â†’ repeat orders.

---

### Example 2: Inspection (L2-39)

**Process:** Quality control inspection before shipment

**Business Model Linkage:**
- **Trading Markets:** UK, Benelux, Australia (all markets require QC)
- **Clients:** All (inspection protects all clients)
- **Sourcing Markets:** China, Vietnam (inspections at source)
- **Categories:** Technical, Showroom, Seasonal, Home (all products inspected)
- **Partners:** N/A (Surity QC team, not outsourced)
- **Suppliers:** All vendors (inspections at their factories)
- **Channel:** Agent
- **Revenue Line:** Indirect (quality gate - prevents defects from reaching clients, protects revenue stream)
- **Cost Line:** QC inspectors (salaries), Travel (to factories in China/Vietnam)
- **Function:** QA and Tech
- **Value Proposition:** Quality assurance â†’ Ensures only compliant products ship
- **Customer Segment:** Clients (primary), Vendors (feedback loop)
- **BM Notes:** "Pre-shipment gate - critical for client trust and repeat business. Failed inspections cost time/money but prevent bigger problems."

**Insight:** This process is a **value protector**. It doesn't create revenue directly, but **prevents revenue loss** from:
- Returns and refunds
- Client dissatisfaction
- Damaged reputation
- Regulatory non-compliance

The cost of inspection (~$300-500/inspection) is **insurance** against much larger downstream costs (returns can be 10-100x the inspection cost).

---

### Example 3: Order Management (L2-37)

**Process:** Managing orders from placement to vendor confirmation

**Business Model Linkage:**
- **Trading Markets:** UK, Benelux, Australia
- **Clients:** Bunnings, Selco, Maxeda
- **Sourcing Markets:** China, Vietnam
- **Categories:** Technical, Showroom, Seasonal, Home
- **Partners:** N/A
- **Suppliers:** Vendor List (orders placed with vendors)
- **Channel:** Agent
- **Revenue Line:** **Agency margin** (THIS IS WHERE REVENUE IS REALIZED - when order is confirmed)
- **Cost Line:** Order processing team (account mgrs, coordinators), IT systems (ERP, portals)
- **Function:** Sourcing Merchandising, Finance
- **Value Proposition:** Order accuracy â†’ Correct products delivered on time
- **Customer Segment:** Clients (order fulfillment), Vendors (order clarity)
- **BM Notes:** "Core transaction process - this is where agency margin is earned. Every order = revenue event."

**Insight:** This process is a **direct revenue generator**. The agency margin (3-8%) is earned when orders are successfully placed and delivered. Process efficiency here directly impacts:
- **Revenue velocity** (cycle time from order to delivery)
- **Revenue quality** (order accuracy â†’ fewer disputes â†’ faster payment)
- **Revenue volume** (capacity to handle more orders)

If Surity processes 200 orders/month at an average value of $50K with 5% margin:
- **Monthly revenue** = 200 Ã— $50K Ã— 5% = **$500K**
- **Annual revenue** = $500K Ã— 12 = **$6M**

Improving order processing cycle time from 2 days to 1 day could increase capacity by 30-40%, unlocking **$1.8-2.4M additional revenue potential**.

## Product Category Impact on Processes

### Category-Specific Process Characteristics

Not all categories are created equal. Different product categories create different process demands:

#### **TECHNICAL** (Tools, Hardware, Building)

**High-Impact Processes:**
- **Test Specification & Validation:** Heavy regulation (CE, UKCA, electrical safety)
- **Factory Audit Program:** Electrical compliance critical
- **Artwork & Compliance:** Technical specifications detailed

**Characteristics:**
- High test lab costs (electrical, mechanical testing)
- Complex compliance requirements
- Longer development cycles (2-3 months Silver Seal â†’ Gold Seal)
- Lower return rates if testing is rigorous

**Example:** Power tools require extensive safety testing (electrical safety, EMC, mechanical strength). Test costs: $2K-5K per product. But avoiding one product recall saves $500K+.

---

#### **SHOWROOM** (Bathroom, Kitchen)

**High-Impact Processes:**
- **Artwork & Packaging:** Luxury positioning, brand-critical
- **E-commerce Data & Image Capture:** High-quality lifestyle imagery
- **Test Specification:** Water efficiency (WERS, WELS), material safety

**Characteristics:**
- High aesthetic standards (showroom quality)
- Material compliance (lead-free brass, water contact materials)
- Installation complexity (requires detailed instructions)
- Higher margin products (agency margin 6-8%)

**Example:** Kitchen faucets must meet WELS (Australia), WERS (UK) water efficiency standards, plus material safety for drinking water contact. Premium positioning justifies higher testing investment.

---

#### **SEASONAL** (Garden, Outdoor)

**High-Impact Processes:**
- **Timing & SLA:** Extreme seasonality (Q4-Q1 peak for Southern Hemisphere, Q1-Q2 for Northern)
- **Shipment Booking:** Container capacity crunch during peak season
- **Order Management:** Short selling window, must hit market timing

**Characteristics:**
- 70%+ of annual volume in 4-month window
- Price sensitivity (promotional products)
- Weather-dependent demand volatility
- Lower margin (3-5%) but high volume

**Example:** Garden furniture for Australian summer (Nov-Jan delivery) must be ordered 4-5 months in advance (Jun-Jul production). Miss the window = miss the season = lost revenue for entire year.

**Process Implication:** Capacity planning is critical. Need surge capacity in Logistics and Order Management during Q2-Q3 to handle 2-3x normal volume.

---

#### **HOME** (Furniture, DÃ©cor)

**High-Impact Processes:**
- **Vendor Engagement:** Fragmented supplier base (many small vendors)
- **Data Management:** High SKU proliferation (colors, styles, sizes)
- **Packaging Design:** Damage prevention critical (furniture breakage)

**Characteristics:**
- Wide assortment breadth (hundreds of SKUs per category)
- Lower testing requirements (fewer safety regulations)
- High packaging cost (protect large/fragile items)
- Decor trends change fast (shorter product lifecycle)

**Example:** Furniture category might have 500+ active SKUs vs. 50 SKUs for power tools. Data management and order accuracy become more complex with high SKU counts.

**Process Implication:** Master data quality is critical. 5% error rate on 500 SKUs = 25 wrong SKUs = client complaints and returns.

### Example Revenue Flow

**Client:** Bunnings (Australia)  
**Product:** Power tools (Technical category)  
**Order Value:** $100,000 FOB  
**Agency Margin:** 5% = **$5,000 revenue**

**Process Costs to Earn This $5K:**

| Process | Cost | % of Revenue | Stage |
|---------|------|--------------|-------|
| Brief (L2-10) | $100 (2 hours @ $50/hr) | 2% | Enabler |
| Vendor Engagement (L2-14) | $200 (4 hours sourcing) | 4% | Enabler |
| Factory Audit (L2-20) | $800 (amortized over 10 orders) | 16% | Enabler |
| Product Testing (L2-28) | $300 (amortized, labs paid) | 6% | Enabler |
| Order Management (L2-37) | $150 (3 hours processing) | 3% | Generator |
| Inspection (L2-39) | $400 (inspector + travel) | 8% | Protector |
| Documentation (L2-47) | $100 (2 hours) | 2% | Supporter |
| Logistics (L2-44) | $200 (booking + coordination) | 4% | Supporter |
| Data Management (L2-05) | $50 (1 hour) | 1% | Supporter |
| **TOTAL PROCESS COST** | **$2,300** | **46%** | |
| **CONTRIBUTION MARGIN** | **$2,700** | **54%** | |

**Insight:** On a typical order, ~46% of agency margin is consumed by direct process costs. Remaining 54% contributes to:
- Overhead (office, IT, management)
- Profit

**Opportunity:** Reducing Order Management cycle time from 3 hours to 2 hours (âˆ’33%) saves $50/order. At 200 orders/month = **$10K/month = $120K/year savings**.

## Using BM Mapping for Strategic Decisions

### Use Case 1: Market Expansion

**Question:** Should Surity expand into Germany?

**Analysis Using BM Mapping:**

1. **Review Trading Markets column** across all processes
   - Current: UK, Benelux, Australia
   - New: Add Germany

2. **Identify processes that need adaptation:**
   - Test Specification (L2-28): Need to add GS mark (German safety standard)
   - Artwork & Compliance (L2-32): German language, additional regulatory icons
   - Documentation & Payment (L2-47): German customs, VAT procedures
   - Data Management (L2-05): German product data requirements

3. **Cost Assessment:**
   - Test lab fees increase: ~$1K/product (add GS testing)
   - Translation services: ~$100/product for artwork
   - Legal/compliance consulting: $20K one-time setup
   - Systems: Minimal (existing ERP can handle)

4. **Revenue Potential:**
   - German DIY market: â‚¬50B (2x UK market size)
   - Target client: OBI, Hornbach, Bauhaus
   - Year 1 target: 500 orders @ avg $50K = $25M order value
   - At 5% margin = **$1.25M additional revenue**

5. **Decision:**
   - Initial investment: ~$120K (setup + first year process adaptation)
   - Breakeven: 96 orders (achievable in Q3-Q4 of Year 1)
   - **Recommendation: PROCEED** - strong business case

---

### Use Case 2: Category Prioritization

**Question:** Which product category should Surity invest more resources in?

**Analysis Using BM Mapping:**

| Category | Current Orders/Month | Avg Order Value | Margin % | Revenue/Month | Process Complexity | ROI |
|----------|---------------------|-----------------|----------|---------------|-------------------|-----|
| **Technical** | 60 | $60K | 5% | $180K | High (testing) | Medium |
| **Showroom** | 40 | $80K | 7% | $224K | High (quality) | **High** |
| **Seasonal** | 80 | $40K | 4% | $128K | Medium | Low |
| **Home** | 20 | $30K | 5% | $30K | Medium (SKU mgmt) | Medium |

**Review Process Impact:**

**Showroom** has:
- Highest margin (7% vs. 4-5% average)
- Highest revenue per order ($224K/month despite fewer orders)
- Manageable complexity (quality standards but established processes)
- Growing client demand (bathroom/kitchen renovation trend)

**Bottleneck Analysis:**
- Current constraint: Artwork & Packaging (L2-32) - only 2 designers
- Can handle max 50 showroom orders/month (currently at 40 = 80% capacity)

**Investment Decision:**
- Hire 1 additional packaging designer: $60K/year
- Unlocks capacity for 20 additional showroom orders/month
- Additional revenue: 20 orders Ã— $80K Ã— 7% = **$112K/month = $1.34M/year**
- ROI: $1.34M / $60K = **22x return** in Year 1

**Recommendation: Invest in Showroom category** - highest return, clear bottleneck to address.

### Use Case 3: Process Automation Prioritization

**Question:** We have $200K budget for process automation. Which processes should we automate first?

**Analysis Using BM Mapping:**

**Step 1: Identify High-Volume Processes**

Filter BM Mapping sheet for:
- High transaction volume (>100/month)
- Manual effort (current process)
- Multiple markets/categories (broad impact)

**Top Candidates:**

| Process | Volume/Month | Manual Hours/Transaction | Total Hours/Month | Hourly Cost | Monthly Cost | Impact |
|---------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| **Data Entry (L3-11)** | 500 updates | 0.5 hrs | 250 hrs | $30 | $7,500 | All markets, all categories |
| **Order Confirmation (L3-53)** | 200 orders | 0.75 hrs | 150 hrs | $40 | $6,000 | Revenue generator |
| **Inspection Scheduling (L3-56)** | 180 inspections | 0.5 hrs | 90 hrs | $35 | $3,150 | Quality gate |
| **Documentation Validation (L3-65)** | 160 shipments | 1 hr | 160 hrs | $35 | $5,600 | Payment enabler |

**Step 2: Automation Feasibility**

| Process | Automation Type | Est. Cost | Time Savings | ROI (Annual) |
|---------|----------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Data Entry | RPA + Validation Rules | $50K | 75% (188 hrs/month) | $67.5K/yr = 1.35x |
| Order Confirmation | Workflow + Email Integration | $60K | 60% (90 hrs/month) | $43.2K/yr = 0.72x |
| Inspection Scheduling | Workflow + Calendar Integration | $40K | 50% (45 hrs/month) | $18.9K/yr = 0.47x |
| Documentation Validation | OCR + Validation Engine | $80K | 70% (112 hrs/month) | $47K/yr = 0.59x |

**Step 3: Strategic Value Beyond Cost Savings**

**Data Entry Automation:**
- Cost savings: $67.5K/year (payback in 8.9 months)
- **Strategic value:** Reduces error rate from 5% â†’ 0.5% (10x improvement)
- Errors cause downstream problems (wrong specs, rework, client complaints)
- Estimated value of error reduction: $150K/year (based on rework costs)
- **Total ROI: $217.5K/year = 4.35x**

**Recommendation:**
1. **Priority 1:** Data Entry Automation ($50K) - Highest ROI when including error reduction
2. **Priority 2:** Order Confirmation Workflow ($60K) - Revenue generator, client-facing
3. **Priority 3:** Documentation Validation ($80K) - Payment enabler, use remaining budget
4. **Total Investment:** $190K (within $200K budget)
